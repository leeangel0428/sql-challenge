# Introduction
Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 9 aka the sql-challenge. For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 9's challenge on SQL. I am using a windows/PC laptop.

# Overview
In this specific challenge, I was challenged to step in the role of a newly hired data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My tasks were to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s, except all that remains in the employee database are 6 csv files. There are three parts to the challenge: data modeling (making an ERD using QuickDBD), data engineering (create table schema for all csv files and import data), and data analysis (use SQL to complete the 8 provided tasks).

# Additional Information/Citations
In this repository, you will find two folders: EmployeeSQL and Starter_Data. EmployeeSQL includes a data-modeling folder that contains the code for the ERD, the PDF, and an image with the visualization. There are also two sql files that contain the data-engineering code and data-analysis codes. The Starter_Data folder contains the 6 original csv files. Aside from the sources cited below, everything used was retained information gathered from my classes and class activities. As always shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
